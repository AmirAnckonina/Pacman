/// Notes
//Reading boards.
1. Create 3 boarders with different patterns. (We assume the maxsize will be 25*80)
2. Read Those 3 files by order, storing the read board in 2D array.
3. Vary the boards with different sizes/different location of the "Legend" area.
4. we should move to the next board when all breadcrumbs are eaten by the pacman. after finish all the 3 , game finished.
5. Lives do not reset after single stage.

//Fruit
1. Create a class:
* Figure
* Value
* Color
* Direction
* CurrPos, NextPos
*** Clarify about time-on-screen and howmany time before each showing of the Fruit?

//Functions
1. Similar to Ghost with some changes.


//Ghosts
1. Smarter Ghosts
Algorithem:
Calculate the shortest route in each move of the ghost (by recursion)
get the first direction from the fastest root, and make a move. 
* Best
* Good
* Novice

-------------------
//Notes EX2

2. Update about forum question. VVV
4. Build menu class  - VVV
3. ThePacmanGame - redesign according to base class changes - VVV
5. Creature - Consts for the icons
7. unite common function from ghost, pacman, etc. to Creature base class
9. Details area 
8. Get init position from the board and update relevant creatures before initilaize them.
6. BFS algorithem implementation
10. Handle differnet name types to boards.txt
11. Strategy for ghosts - polymorphizem ?
1. Test Boards with problematic structure.
12. build functions to collect pacman and ghost , similar to legendPos
13. operator function == which compare
14. Add condition - when pacman go through invisible tunnels, check if tunnel exists in the other side
 + legend area tunnel check
 15. Add default values to constructor and not intialize it in declaraion.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 //Questions to Kirsh
 1. Design for consts (Especially creatureIcon), + maybe Direction
 ******* put enum inside creature class. enum is static, only one time created.
 ******* consider create pacman constans header file 
 ******* enum class outside or regular enum inside class
 ******* We not must to use empty constructor, only if there is copy constructor
 ******* const char -> should be intialized immiediatly -> consider to send it via constructor and then it will be intialized once.
But what about the Fruit??

VVVV

 2. Boards demands - check about first line decides the size of the board?


 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. Smart ghost can unite and move together. -> We should break that!
 2. Implement String sort to file names. 
 3. dirent.h ? dirlist ? filesystem. C++ version
 4. A star , BFS , DFS
 5. We can decide how to implement th levels of the ghosts. We not must to go by the instructions.
 6. bonus for implemetation of very good ghosts.
 7. one sided tunnel - should blocked.
 8. while one of the board isn't correct , give an option to move to the next board
 9. Build function to check if board is valid.
 10. & should clear all the chars in range. even if border appears.
