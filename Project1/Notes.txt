  14. Congrats + You won fix change finish message- Amir 
  4. base all "initCreature" creature function on constructors and distructors. //Amir 
  10. Ghosts collision check every X times. consider genertate random or put on STAY to few moves. //Chen // Amir Completet union function.
  8. BFS - Save 5 or 4 last position, insert them into vector and implement full BFS only every 5-4 turns // Amir

  1. Build flow function which run all board one by one. //Amir VVVVVVVV

  2. base game endong on number of total breadcrums and NOT on comparing score to breadcrumbs. //Chen VVVVVV

  3. arrange readRawTemplate, singleFruitSession before testing. //Amir // VVVVVVVVVVVVV


  5. Bonus - eating fruit with the value 9 will add live pacman //Chen -// VVVVVVVVV

  6. BFS - running with 4 or more ghosts // Chen Test --> No problem yet, but keep in checking. // VVVVVV

  7. exit option from pause menu or between gase sessions //Amir // VVVVVVVVVV


  9. consider to use ghostTurn param to run BFS not on the same session ---> ghost 1 yes ghost 2 no ...EvenOdd // Chen VVVVV


  11. Try to prevent pacman and ghosts to eat Tunnels. // VVVVVVV

  12. validate number of pacmans, ghosts, legend --> EXTRA. 

  13. Test fruit generate random position on board with a lot of borders --> consider using vector array with all the valid positions. // VVVV


  15. Keep score and lives between session - init pacman // Chen
