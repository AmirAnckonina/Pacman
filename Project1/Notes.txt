/// Notes
//Reading boards.
1. Create 3 boarders with different patterns. (We assume the maxsize will be 25*80)
2. Read Those 3 files by order, storing the read board in 2D array.
3. Vary the boards with different sizes/different location of the "Legend" area.
4. we should move to the next board when all breadcrumbs are eaten by the pacman. after finish all the 3 , game finished.
5. Lives do not reset after single stage.

//Fruit
1. Create a class:
* Figure
* Value
* Color
* Direction
* CurrPos, NextPos
*** Clarify about time-on-screen and howmany time before each showing of the Fruit?

//Functions
1. Similar to Ghost with some changes.


//Ghosts
1. Smarter Ghosts
Algorithem:
Calculate the shortest route in each move of the ghost (by recursion)
get the first direction from the fastest root, and make a move. 
* Best
* Good
* Novice
